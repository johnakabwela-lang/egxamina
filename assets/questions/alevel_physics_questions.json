      "question": "What is the de Broglie wavelength formula?",
      "options": [
        "λ = h/p",
        "E = mc²",
        "F = ma",
        "v = u + at"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "λ = h/p",
      "explanation": "The de Broglie wavelength formula (λ = h/p) relates the wavelength of matter to its momentum, where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum."
